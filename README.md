# Website Scraper and RSS Feed Generator for Slack Integration

## Project Overview
This project involves a Python application that automatically scrapes a specified website for information, generates an RSS feed with this data, and integrates the feed into Slack. It is designed to run on AWS, utilizing services like Lambda and S3 for hosting and scheduling. This tool is ideal for teams looking to automate the process of monitoring and sharing updates from specific web sources directly in Slack.

### Scraping Targets
- **Databricks Platform Release Notes**: Cover features developed for the Databricks environment.
- **Databricks Runtime Release Notes**: Include proprietary features, optimizations, and version compatibility.
- **Databricks SQL Release Notes**: Detail features for the Databricks SQL user interface, SQL warehouses, available versions, rollout schedule, and version-specific features.
- **Databricks Developer Tools and SDKs Release Notes**: Cover IDE extensions, plugins, command-line interfaces, and SDKs.
- **Delta Live Tables Release Notes**: Include features, bug fixes, and runtime upgrade process.

## Features
- Automated web scraping of Databricks release notes
- RSS feed generation covering all release vehicles
- Integration with Slack
- AWS Lambda for script execution
- AWS S3 for feed hosting
- Scheduled execution using AWS EventBridge


## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- AWS account
- Slack workspace
- Basic understanding of AWS services (Lambda, S3, EventBridge)
- Familiarity with Python scripting and web scraping

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
        git clone [repository-url]
2. Install required Python libraries:



## Setup
### AWS Configuration
- Set up AWS Lambda with a Python runtime.
- Configure an S3 bucket for storing the RSS feed.
- Schedule the Lambda function using AWS EventBridge.

### Slack Integration
- Use Slack's `/feed subscribe [RSS feed URL]` command to integrate the RSS feed.
- For custom Slack integrations, refer to Slack API documentation.

## Usage
Run the script manually or let it execute as scheduled on AWS Lambda. The script will scrape the specified website, update the RSS feed, and the updated feed will be available in the configured Slack channel.

## Customization
You can customize the scraping logic, RSS feed structure, and scheduling frequency based on your requirements.
